1. Unzip the folder
2. Enter into directory and execute command "npm install" to install dependencies
3. DATA DUMP : Now execute command "npm start" this will generate a text file JsonData.json which contains the imported data
   from battles.csv and dumped into mongodb (code for dumping data is written in routes/dump.js)
4. LIST : To list the all the places data i.e. (location + region ) first un command "npm start" and
   then hit the end point "https//localhost:3000/toppr/list"
5. COUNT : To get the count of places data hit the endpoint "https//localhost:3000/toppr/count"
6. STATS : To get the stats hit the endpoint "https//localhost:3000/toppr/stats"
7. SEARCH : To get the search/query based results hit the end point "http://localhost:3000/toppr/search?q={queryString}"
    for example : "http://localhost:3000/toppr/search?q=battle"

** Because of the time constraint i had implemented search/query filter only on "name" attribute, please consider it.

Note : To use the search filter url should be in this format "http://localhost:3000/toppr/search?q={queryString}"
       because of the time constraint i had to use the get() method. Please consider it while evaluation.
